        "## The Problem: LLMs Love Tables, But Notebooks Need Better\n",
        "\n",
        "If you've used Claude, ChatGPT, or other LLM interfaces lately, you've noticed something: they love presenting information in tables. And for good reason. Tables are incredibly effective at organizing structured information.\n",
        "\n",
        "But here's the disconnect: when you're analyzing data in a Python notebook, you need tables that live in your code, not just in a chat interface. You want the same control over tables that you have with plotnine or seaborn for visualizations. You want reproducible, extensible, and beautiful tables that work with your data pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is where Great Tables shines. Great Tables is a Python library designed for quickly generating sophisticated tables in your notebook, whether you're writing the code yourself or working with an LLM assistant. More importantly, it gives you something Markdown tables can't: a programmatic recipe that adapts to your data and extends with your needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's explore why Great Tables is the ideal choice when working with LLMs to analyze and present data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Progression: Text -> Markdown -> Great Tables\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand the value of Great Tables, let's see how the same information looks when presented in three different ways. We'll use a realistic scenario: analyzing GitHub repository metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Stage 1: Paragraph Text\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how an LLM might initially describe repository data:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "The great-tables repository has 1,834 stars and 67 forks, with 23 open issues and 234 closed issues. It has merged 456 pull requests and the last commit was 2 days ago. The polars repository is much larger with 23,456 stars and 1,234 forks, currently has 345 open issues with 5,678 closed, has merged 8,934 pull requests, and was updated 1 day ago. The pandas repository is the largest with 38,934 stars...\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem with this chunk of text is that it is exhausting to read. Finding patterns or comparing values requires some mental gymnastics here. You can't quickly spot which repos are most active or which need attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Stage 2: Markdown Table\n",
        "\n",
        "The natural next step is to structure this information in a table format. This is exactly what LLMs often do when you ask them to present data more clearly. Let's improve this with a Markdown table:\n",
        "\n",
        "```markdown\n",
        "| Repository | Language | Stars | Forks | Open Issues | Closed Issues | PRs Merged | Days Since Commit |\n",
        "|------------|----------|-------|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|\n",
        "| great-tables | Python | 1834 | 67 | 23 | 234 | 456 | 2 |\n",
        "| polars | Rust | 23456 | 1234 | 345 | 5678 | 8934 | 1 |\n",
        "| pandas | Python | 38934 | 15678 | 2345 | 23456 | 12345 | 3 |\n",
        "| duckdb | C++ | 15234 | 890 | 123 | 3456 | 5678 | 1 |\n",
        "| quarto-cli | TypeScript | 8234 | 456 | 89 | 1234 | 2345 | 5 |\n",
        "| plotly.py | Python | 13456 | 2345 | 234 | 4567 | 6789 | 4 |\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Much better! The table structure makes comparisons easier. But we're still facing limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- numbers aren't formatted for readability (1834 vs 1,834)\n",
        "- no visual cues for what's important\n",
        "- can't highlight concerning patterns (old commits, high open issues)\n",
        "- static, so if data changes, you need to regenerate the entire table\n",
        "- no room for additional context (titles, footnotes, sources)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Stage 3: Great Tables\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let's see the same data as a Great Tables table. Here's an example prompt you might use:\n",

        "When you combine LLMs with Great Tables, you unlock a powerful iterative workflow that's greater than the sum of its parts. Instead of just asking for analysis or just asking for a table, you can have a conversation that progressively refines both the data understanding and its presentation. Here's what this workflow typically looks like in practice:\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how Great Tables fits into this workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **You**: \"Analyze these sales trends and create a table showing regions, current quarter sales, and trend sparklines\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **LLM**: generates trend values and Great Tables code with `.fmt_nanoplot()`\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **You**: see visual trends immediately, spot the declining region, ask follow-up questions\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **LLM**: updates the code to add conditional formatting on the declining region\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Result**: a publication-ready table that's also a reproducible recipe\n",
        "\n",
        "This workflow is impossible with Markdown tables. You'd be stuck asking the LLM to describe trends in text or regenerating static tables repeatedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Human Visual Processing > Text Processing\n",
        "\n",
        "Humans are visual creatures. We process information much faster when it's presented visually rather than via text. Consider this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Text description**: \"The upload endpoint has an average latency of 1,243ms with a P95 of 2,456ms and an error rate of 5.1%, which is significantly higher than other endpoints...\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Markdown table**: Better, but you still need to scan and compare numbers mentally.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Great Tables with color gradients**: Instant visual hit as red cells jump out immediately. You know there's a problem before you even read the numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs are great at generating structured text, but they can't see the output the way humans do. Great Tables bridges this gap by transforming LLM-generated structured data into visually optimized presentations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Practical Tips for Using Great Tables with LLMs\n",
        "\n",
        "After working extensively with LLMs to generate Great Tables code, we've learned what works well and what doesn't. The key is being specific about what you want while leveraging the compositional nature of the API. Here are the strategies that consistently produce the best results:\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on our experience, here are key strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Ask for Great Tables code directly**: \"Create a Great Tables table with...\" works well with modern LLMs\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Specify formatting needs**: \"Format currency with thousands separators\" or \"Add color gradients to highlight outliers\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Request structural elements**: \"Add a spanner for financial columns\" or \"Group rows by department\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Iterate compositionally**: Start simple, then ask for additions: \"Now add a title and source note\"\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Leverage nanoplots**: If you have time-series or trend data, explicitly ask for sparklines: \"Add a trend column using fmt_nanoplot\"\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Provide data context**: Share the data structure or a few sample rows so the LLM knows what columns are available\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion: The Right Tool for the Job\n",
        "\n",
        "When you're analyzing data in a notebook with LLM assistance, you need tables that are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Visual: easy for humans to process at a glance\n",
        "- Reproducible: run the same code with new data\n",
        "- Extensible: start simple, add sophistication as needed\n",
        "- Structured: support titles, groups, spanners, footnotes\n",
        "- Intelligent: conditional formatting, color gradients, sparklines\n",
        "\n",
        "Markdown tables are fine for simple, static displays. But when you're doing real analysis work, Great Tables gives you high-quality output with programmatic control.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just as you'd use plotnine or seaborn for visualizations in your notebook, we believe that Great Tables is the right choice for tables. And when you combine it with LLM assistance, you get the best of both worlds: natural language specification with code-level control.\n",
        "\n",
        "The future of data analysis involves humans and LLMs working together. Great Tables is built for exactly this collaboration and it gives you the structure and tools you need while remaining accessible enough for LLMs to generate valid code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Try it out in your next notebook. Ask your favorite LLM to create a Great Tables table from your data. You might be surprised how well it works! And you'll likely be delighted with how much more effective your tables become."
